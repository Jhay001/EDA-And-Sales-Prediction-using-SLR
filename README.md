The "Advertising Impact Analysis" project aims to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditure across different channels (such as TV, radio, online) and its impact on sales or revenue. The goal of the project is to understand how various advertising strategies influence consumer behavior and drive business outcomes, specifically in terms of sales performance.
By conducting an advertising impact analysis, the project aims to provide valuable insights to companies on the effectiveness of their advertising strategies, identify the most impactful advertising channels, and optimize marketing efforts to maximize sales performance and overall business success.
